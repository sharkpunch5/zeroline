## Description
This algorithm is designed to identify and trade trends in the foreign exchange (forex) market. It is constructed using a set of technical indicators that trigger trade entry and exit and uses money management to limit risk and maximise upside potential.

It has been developed and tested in Metatrader 4 and Trading View, this algorithm is written in pine script can be deployed as a strategy in the Trading View and used for back testing on any instrument that is available on the platform. 

Testing across the major pairs (USD, EUD, JPY, CHF, GBP, AUD, NZD) yields a *theoretical* annualized ROI of ~30% per annum with default configuration however it is critical to note that the performance will decline in practical application once rules are added to avoid the volatility associated news events and limit exposure.
